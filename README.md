# VanillaTreeSPH
A simple smoothed-particle hydrodynamics code that uses a tree algorithm to find neighbour particles. Each particle in a SPH simulation does not only have a location, a velocity and a mass like in a normal N-body simulation, but can also have pressure and density.

Here is a simple example of a collision of two bodies consisting of particles of the same mass. The particles were coloured according to their speed, pressure and density.
